# Process Limiting and Sorting Feature - Implementation Summary

## Overview

This implementation adds the ability to limit the number of processes displayed and sort them by various criteria (CPU usage, memory usage, name, or PID), both via command-line arguments and dynamically at runtime through keyboard controls.

## Changes Made

### 1. Command-Line Arguments (main.py)

Added three new command-line arguments:
- `--limit N` - Limit the number of processes displayed
- `--sort-by {cpu,memory,name,pid}` - Sort processes by the specified field
- `--sort-order {asc,desc}` - Sort in ascending or descending order

These arguments set environment variables that are read by the Aquarium class.

### 2. ProcessManager (src/core/process_manager.py)

Added support for process limiting and sorting:

**New Fields:**
- `process_limit: Optional[int]` - Maximum number of processes to display
- `sort_by: str` - Field to sort by (cpu, memory, name, pid)
- `sort_order: str` - Sort order (asc, desc)

**New Methods:**
- `set_process_limit(limit)` - Set the process limit
- `set_sort_config(sort_by, sort_order)` - Configure sorting
- `_apply_sort_and_limit(processes)` - Apply sorting and limiting to process dictionary

**Modified Methods:**
- `update()` - Now applies sorting and limiting after retrieving processes

### 3. Aquarium (src/visuals/aquarium.py)

Added runtime configuration and UI updates:

**Initialization:**
- Reads `AQUARIUM_LIMIT`, `AQUARIUM_SORT_BY`, `AQUARIUM_SORT_ORDER` environment variables
- Applies settings to ProcessManager

**New Methods:**
- `_cycle_process_limit()` - Cycle through predefined limits (None, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200)
- `_cycle_sort_field()` - Cycle through sort fields (cpu, memory, name, pid)
- `_toggle_sort_order()` - Toggle between ascending and descending

**Keyboard Controls:**
- `L` key - Cycle process limit
- `S` key - Cycle sort field
- `O` key - Toggle sort order

**UI Updates:**
- Stats panel now displays current limit and sort configuration
- Help panel updated with new keyboard shortcuts

### 4. Documentation

**README.md:**
- Added "Process Limiting and Sorting" section with examples
- Documented command-line options
- Documented runtime keyboard controls
- Added use cases

### 5. Testing

**test_limit_and_sort.py:**
Comprehensive test suite covering:
- Basic ProcessManager functionality
- Process limiting
- Sorting by memory (descending)
- Sorting by CPU (descending)
- Sorting by name (ascending)
- Sorting by PID (ascending)
- Dynamic configuration changes

All tests pass successfully.

**demo_limit_and_sort.py:**
Interactive demo script showing:
- Example command-line invocations
- Explanation of keyboard controls
- Use case examples

## Usage Examples

### Command-Line

```bash
# Display top 10 processes by CPU usage
python main.py --limit 10 --sort-by cpu --sort-order desc

# Display top 20 processes by memory usage
python main.py --limit 20 --sort-by memory --sort-order desc

# Display first 5 processes alphabetically
python main.py --limit 5 --sort-by name --sort-order asc
```

### Runtime Controls

While the application is running in GUI mode:
- Press `L` to cycle through limits: None → 10 → 20 → 50 → 100 → 200 → None
- Press `S` to cycle through sort fields: CPU → Memory → Name → PID → CPU
- Press `O` to toggle sort order: Descending ↔ Ascending

The current settings are always visible in the statistics panel.

## Implementation Notes

### Design Decisions

1. **Separation of Concerns:** The sorting and limiting logic is implemented in ProcessManager, keeping it independent of the visualization layer.

2. **Environment Variables:** Command-line arguments are converted to environment variables, allowing consistent configuration across different entry points.

3. **Dynamic Configuration:** Runtime changes are supported through keyboard controls, providing an interactive user experience.

4. **Backward Compatibility:** All changes are optional - the application works exactly as before when no limits or sorting are specified.

5. **Consistent API:** Both psutil and future eBPF sources can use the same interface for sorting and limiting.

### Performance Considerations

- Sorting is performed once per update cycle, not per frame
- The limit is applied after sorting, reducing memory usage for large process counts
- Dictionary operations are optimized using list comprehensions

### Edge Cases Handled

- None/null values in process data (CPU, memory percentages)
- Empty process lists
- Invalid sort fields (falls back to CPU)
- Invalid sort orders (falls back to descending)
- Changing configurations dynamically during runtime

## Testing Results

All 7 test cases pass:
1. ✓ Basic functionality works
2. ✓ Process limiting works
3. ✓ Memory sorting works
4. ✓ CPU sorting works
5. ✓ Name sorting works
6. ✓ PID sorting works
7. ✓ Dynamic configuration changes work

## Files Modified

- `.gitignore` - Added screenshot exclusion
- `README.md` - Added feature documentation
- `demo_limit_and_sort.py` - New demo script
- `main.py` - Added CLI arguments
- `src/core/process_manager.py` - Added sorting and limiting logic
- `src/visuals/aquarium.py` - Added runtime controls and UI updates
- `test_limit_and_sort.py` - New comprehensive test suite

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future versions:
1. Custom limit values through UI input
2. Save/load preferred configurations
3. Sort by additional fields (threads, create time)
4. Multi-field sorting
5. Filter by process name pattern
6. Historical trending of top processes
